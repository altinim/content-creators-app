The main issue I faced today is using Redux to implement data passing through components without the need to use props, I have watched few blogs and short tutorials on how REDUX works, I have also managed to:

-   Create a Cart Page
-   Add product to the cart
-   Remove the products from the cart
-   Adding/removing products to your cart is only possible as a user.

Each user has their own products.
